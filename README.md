## Quantitative Analysis using Machine Learning 

#### As a Data and Statistics enthusiast, I apply all the theoretical knowledge I've gathered to analyze stock market data and extract meaningful patterns and forecasts.
#### So far, I have explored Unsupervised Learning for Algorithmic trading. Using volatility analysis, unsupervised learning can cluster similar stocks for anomaly detection and feature optimization. I have utilized the following techniques to bring new features and technical indicators to the data:
1. Garman-Klass volatility.
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI).
3. Bollinger Bands.
4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
5. Fama-French three-factor model.

#### The addition of these features has improved the clustering mechanism. For instance, instead of random centering, RSI-based clustering has improved the cluster formations.
