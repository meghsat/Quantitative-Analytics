## Quantitative Analysis using Machine Learning 

#### As a Data and Statistics enthusiast, I apply all the theoretical knowledge I've gathered to analyze stock market data and extract meaningful patterns and forecasts. I mostly play with the S&P Index data and individual Stock price data.
#### So far:
1. I have explored an [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/meghsat/Quantitative-Analytics/blob/master/Unsupervised%20Quantitative%20Analysis.ipynb) approach for Algorithmic trading. Using volatility analysis, unsupervised learning can cluster similar stocks for anomaly detection and feature optimization. I have utilized the following techniques to bring new features and technical indicators to the data:
    * Garman-Klass volatility.
    * Relative Strength Index (RSI).
    * Bollinger Bands.
    * MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
    * Fama-French three-factor model.
2. I have also devised an [investment strategy](https://github.com/meghsat/Quantitative-Analytics/blob/master/ML%20based%20approaches/Ticker%20Purchase%20Allocation%20using%20Graph%20Theory%20and%20Sharpe%20Ratio.ipynb) using graph theory, which utilizes Sharpe ratios to diversify stock investments across multiple uncorrelated stocks selected from a set of correlated assets.

#### The addition of these features has improved the clustering mechanism. For instance, instead of random centering, RSI-based clustering has improved the cluster formations.
